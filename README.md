# PkgCite

This repo contains a quick function to generate a .bib file with references for `R` packages used in a project.
If run at the end of a script, it fetches the loaded libraries, generates a reference for each of them, and saves the .bib file in a specified directory. The .bib file can then be called from a LaTeX file to create software citations. Right now, it is just for `R` packages.

The idea is to make it easier and common to cite user-written software in academic publications.
